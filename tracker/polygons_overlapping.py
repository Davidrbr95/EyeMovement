polygons_overlapping.py

This module provides a function for testing two or a set of polygons on 
whether they are overlapping or touching.

Contains:
 * pair_overlapping 
   Finds out if two polygons are overlapping or touching.
 * collection_overlapping
   Finds out which polygons in a set are overlapping or touching.
